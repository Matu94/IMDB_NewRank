# IMDB_NewRank

The aim of the hobby project is to acquire Python programing and webscraping knowledge more deeply. 
The basic idea was provided by an earlier interview task.


The algorithm currently collects the titles, links, values, views, and number of Oscar awards for IMDBâ€™s first 15 films into one structure. 
It then sets up a new ranking according to a unique scoring system. 

The new system takes into account how much the viewership of a given film differs from the most watched film, as well as how many Oscars it has received. Based on these values, it modifies the original score. 
The resulting list is rearranged by the algorithm based on a score, resulting in a new order.
